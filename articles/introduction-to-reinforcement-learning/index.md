### Introduction

In **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, agents are trained to maximize the total rewards. In a simpler term, the RL agent is rewarded for correct moves and punished for the wrong ones. In turn, the agent tries to maximize the right moves while minimizing the wrong moves. 
In literature, RL is known as a semi-supervised learning model in machine learning, a technique which allows an agent to take actions and interact with an environment to maximize the total rewards for completing a task. 
When compared to other unsupervised learning methods, RL is different in terms of its goals. While the goal in unsupervised learning is to find similarities and differences between data points, reinforcement learning's goal is to find a suitable action model that would maximize the total cumulative reward of the agent.
Reinforcement Learning, as stated above employs a system of **rewards** and **penalties** to compel the computer to solve a problem on its own. Human involvement is limited to changing the environment and tweaking the system of rewards and penalties. As the computer maximizes its reward, it is prone to seek unexpected ways of doing it. Human involvement is focused on preventing it from exploiting the system and motivating the machine to perform the task in the way expected. 
RL is important especially when there is no sure way of performing a task. However, there are rules which the model has to follow to perform its duties correctly. 

### Key Concepts

In RL we have key concepts that have to be defined. They include agents, state, action, rewards and the environment.

1.	**Agent**. An agent is an autonomous entity which observes and acts upon an environment. The agent learns which actions to take by a process of trial and error. This process of trial and error requires the agent to explore his available actions on the fly. Whenever an agent tries an action, it will receive a reward which indicates how good or bad the selected action was. In the long run an agent will try to maximize selecting actions that resulted in high rewards while attempting to reduce the actions which may lead to low rewards.

2.	**State**. The state represents the decision-making factors under consideration being observed by the agent.

3.	**Action**. An action represents an optimal action being selected by the agent, which may change or affect the state and reward.

4.	**Reward**. A reward in RL represents the gains and losses in network performance for taking a particular action on a particular state in the previous time instance.

5.	**Environment**. The environment is where the agent acts. As to how the environment reacts to certain actions is defined by a model which we may or may not know.

Let's consider a simple problem to better understand reinforcement learning and its key concepts. We take an example of a child learning on how to walk.

The child is an **agent** trying to navigate through the **environment** which is the surface in which it walks. By taking an **action** in this case, walking, the child tries to move from one **state** to another step by step. The child gets a **reward** (let's say a muffin) after taking a defined couple of clearly defined number of steps (task). The child does not receive any **reward** when he/she is not able to walk. 

This is an example of a simple reinforcement learning problem.

### Most Used Reinforcement Learning Algorithm

There are a couple of RL algorithms used in solving problems today. They include Q-learning, [Policy Gradients (PG)](/https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1713-policy-gradient-methods-for-reinforcement-learning-with-function-approximation.pdf/) and [Actor-Critics](/https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1786-actor-critic-algorithms.pdf/). In this article, we will explain these three popular algorithms used to solve many RL problems. 

#### Q-learning (most popular).

In the simplest form, Q-learning can be described as a value-based reinforcement learning algorithm used to find an optimal action-selection policy using a Q-function. The main goal is to maximize the value function Q by selecting the best of all possible actions.

![q-learning](/engineering-education/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning/q-learning.PNG)
*[Image Source: Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-4095-0_2)*

The Q-function uses the Bellmanâ€™s equation taking in two inputs: **state (s)** and **action (a)**.

Using the above Q-function, we get the values of Q to be stored in the cells of the **Q-table** which is basically a look-up table where we store then calculate the maximum expected future rewards for actions at each state.

As all the values in the Q-table are initially set to zero, this makes the first action the agent takes to be completely random. The values in the table are then updated iteratively for each state-action pair until the function Q eventually converges to Qnew.

The **discount factor** in the Q-learning algorithm is a value between 0 and 1. It tells how important future rewards are to the current state. If the discount factor is set to 0, the agent will completely lack foresight and will only learn about actions that produce immediate rewards. On the other hand, setting it to 1 will prompt the agent to evaluate each of its actions based on the sum total of all its future rewards.

**Learning rate (lr)** can simply be defined as how much you accept the new value over the old value. A learning rate of 0 will mean nothing new will be learnt by the agent as a number multiplied by zero is always zero. A learning rate of 1 will mean the old value will be completely discarded and the agent will have learnt something.
   
There is also a need to balance the agent's exploration and exploitation efforts as it must take random actions which ought to bring greater returns in the long run. Without this balance, the agent might just opt for an immediate reward every time. This is achieved by using the [epsilon-greedy algorithm](/https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2017/11/30/the-epsilon-greedy-algorithm/).

The algorithm works in such a way that as the agent keeps progressing further and further into the particular task, it will lean more into exploiting the knowledge it has already gathered rather than investigating the environment. 

That's Q-learning in a nutshell. 

#### Policy Gradients (PG)

Value function approximation has been applied to a wide variety of task domains and has proved to be a strong solution for many difficult problems. However, [as this paper suggests,](/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228957531_Policy_Gradient_vs_Value_Function_Approximation_A_Reinforcement_Learning_Shootout/) drawbacks with value function approximation such as most implementations leading to deterministic policies even when the optimal policy is stochastic have led to probabilistic policies being ignored which would have led to superior performance in the model. 

An alternative reinforcement learning method that would bypass these limitations is a Policy Gradient method. 

Policy Gradient is a type of reinforcement learning technique which relies upon optimizing policies with respect to the long term cumulative reward by a process known as Gradient Descent. In other words, the objective of a Policy Gradient is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative future reward to be received starting from any given time, t.

Unlike in Q-learning where an agent has to learn the approximation of the value fuction and basing the policy on a direct estimate of the long term expected reward, Policy Gradient attempts to search the policy space directly in order to follow the gradient of the average reward. In addition, PG is able to express stochastic optimal policies and to be robust to small changes in the underlying function approximation.

#### Actor-Critics (AC)

![actor-critic](/engineering-education/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning/actor-critic.png)<br>
*[Image Source: Berkeley](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse-fa17/f17docs/lecture_5_actor_critic_pdf)*

While Q-learning focuses on learning the value function, or learning of a policy directly as in Policy Gradients method, Actor-Critics (AC) method tends to learn both simultenously with the **Actor** learning the policy and the **Critic** the value function.

AC work well when we have both an infinite input and an infinite output.
The actor takes in the state of the current environment then determines the best action to take, thereafter, the critic plays the evaluation role by taking in the environment state and action and returning an action score.

AC models tend to require much less training the PG methods.

### Applications of Reinforcement Learning

#### Games

Reinforcement Learning is quite widely used in building AI for playing computer games. In 2016, Deepmind Technologies, a UK based Artificial Intelligence and Research Company built AlphaGo, an RL controlled computer program that plays the board game, Go (an ancient Chinese board game). The computer program was able to beat Lee Sedol, a Korean Go world champion 4-1 in a 5 match game. Feel free to [read more on the AlphaGo case study](/https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far/).

Subsequent versions of AlphaGo such as AlphaGo Zero and MuZero became even more powerful as they were completely self-taught using RL without learning from human games and being taught the game rules respectively.

#### Robotics

In industries, robots are used to perform various tasks. For example, at DeepMind, a London-based artificial-intelligence company Google acquired in 2014, gave AI robots, control over [Googleâ€™s data center to manage part of its cooling infrastructure.](/https://deepmind.com/blog/article/safety-first-ai-autonomous-data-centre-cooling-and-industrial-control/) The AI robots exploits the reinforcement learning (RL) technique, a similar approach to that used in AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero and MuZero which learns through trial and error. The algorithm was fed information gathered from the data centers and left to determine which cooling configurations would effectively reduce energy consumption. Googleâ€™s data center energy spending was found to have reduced by up to 40%.

#### Trading and Finance

[According to this paper,](/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-38364-0_28/) Reinforcement Learning has been used for predicting stock prices as well as predicting future sales. The RL agent can decide on whether to buy, hold or sell a particular stock. The RL model, usually a supervised time series model, is evaluated by using the current market bench mark standards in order to ensure that itâ€™s operating optimally and to reduce the errors in the model. A great example would be the IBMâ€™s financial trading platform which uses a RL agent for trading. The AI agent computes a reward function based on the profit or losses made in every financial transaction.
